        I am an ambitious student taking Bachelor of Software Engineering program at Auckland
        University of Technology. I have learnt how to gain experience in programming through
        making projects. I have landed a job at United Nations to develop a website using
        HTML,CSS and Drupal ,also I have made projects that shows my experience with
        Python, C++ , HTML, and CSS, I am currently working on Django framework to
        develop my own website. I think I fit the role of being a backend developer at your
        company, as a hard worker who is willing to gain more experience.
